        </p>
        <p>
          The following are common exercises that we encorage our clients to do
          as part of their daily exercise routine.
        </p>
        <p>Burpee</p>
        <p>
          Burpee are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and
          endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend
          your hands forward, lick your feet back and then forvard again
          quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
        </p>
        <p>Plank</p>
        <p>
          Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up
          position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as
          long as you can.
        </p>
        <p>Mountain Climber</p>
        <p>
          Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the
          floor in a push up position then bring one lee up to your chest and
          then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a
          mountain).
